# Speech-to-Emotion
Speech-to-emotion recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is a powerful approach for analyzing emotional cues from audio data. The combination leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction (such as spectral patterns in audio) and LSTMs for temporal modeling (capturing sequential dependencies in speech).
